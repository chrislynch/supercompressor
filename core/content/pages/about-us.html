Ecommerce Centric is part of the new generation of internet retailing businesses.  We provide a platform for distributors to promote and sell products online to consumers. In addition we source products direct from the manufacturer and provide our customers with best value.

The business is a fusion of easy to use and quick to deploy website technology and very astute purchasing capability.  The business aims to connect buyers and sellers online. This is achieved by two principle routes.

Ecommerce Centric has its own sales platform which enables suppliers with limited online experience to sell via one of Ecommerce Centric’s own websites, this fall into three categories, Home and Garden www.HomeandGardenCentric.com , Personal Care and Beauty www.BeautyCentric.com and Gifts www.GiftCentric.com.  The platform allows suppliers to either deliver direct to the customer or place stock inventory with us to fulfil. In addition to facilitating UK based business to sell online we also look overseas for excellent value products to import ourselves and promote to our customers.

For suppliers with more established infrastructure we are extremely experienced in building, managing and optimising successful business to consumer and business to business ecommerce platforms for customers to run themselves. This activity is conducted via our digital commerce consultancy www.gravit-e.co.uk using our in-house developed technology.  We estimate that to date over £500 million of ecommerce activity has passed through our platform.

In short if you are a supplier wishing to reach customers online we are the ideal partner, if you are a customer looking for excellent value and quality visit our sites. 

We thank you in advance for working with us.
