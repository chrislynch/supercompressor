# Rats Infest Cheltenham Homes After Freak Weather #

The [Gloucestershire Echo](http://www.thisisgloucestershire.co.uk/people/Gloucestershire%20Echo/profile.html) is reporting that heavy rain and warm weather have caused a plague of rats to descend on homes across Cheltenham.

Thousands of the rodents are apparently building nests close to properties in the town, according to a local pest control expert, with as some residents now having as many as 600 rats within 20 feet of their homes.

â€‹Summer rains can often force rats to migrate to escape rising water levels.

Barbara Exley, head of public protection for Cheltenham Borough Council, had this to say: "The general trend is that there are more rats across the country. However in Cheltenham the number of requests for our service is steady, although this does fluctuate depending on the time of year."

With freak weather like the summer rains on the increase, we expect to see more and more pests forced to migrate and relocate to new environments.
