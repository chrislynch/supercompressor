# Frequently Asked Pest Control Questions About Mice #

Mice are a very common problem and can be found in houses, lofts, garages, and other out-buildings. The major problem with mice is that they are naturally incontinent, trailing urine and feaces around as they move. If a mouse comes into contact with food, there is a significant risk of food poisoning, such as Salmonella or E.coli. Mice can also cause damage to household wiring and insulation, gas pipes, and woodwork. Instances of electrical fires and floods have been attributed to mouse damage.

It is almost impossible to prevent mice from entering a property. Mice can fit through very small gaps and will seek out food sources whereever they can.

## What kind of mouse is in my house? ##

The most common mouse infestations are from **House Mice** and **Wood Mice**. House Mice are almost entirely dependant on human habitation to survive, whilst Wood Mice live in the countryside (e.g. in hedgerows) as well as houses, sheds and garages etc.

## Where should I look for mice in my house? ##

Mice often build nests in houses during the winter months. Mouse nests are built wherever there is access to a good source of food. Spaces under floors and lofts are favoured places for nests, which are built out of cloth, wool, paper, plastics and any other material that is available to them. Mouse holes are normally 20 â€“30mm in diameter.

## Is that a rat or a mouse? ##

Rats are easily distinguishable from mice by their large heads and feet. A rats head and feet will appear noticebly, even disproportionately, large compared to its body.
