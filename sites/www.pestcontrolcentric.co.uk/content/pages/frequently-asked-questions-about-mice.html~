# Frequently Asked Pest Control Questions About Mice #
Mice are an all-too common problem, in houses, lofts and out-buildings. Mice are incontinent, and as they move around they dribble urine and leave droppings. If they come into contact with food there is a risk of food poisoning, such as Salmonella and E.coli.

In addition, mice often cause damage to household wiring and insulation. It is very difficult to prevent mice from entering a property, especially if there is easy access to a source of food â€“ mice are able to squeeze through the smallest gaps (if you can fit a pencil in a hole, a mouse will be able to pass through it!).

We offer a wide choice of solutions for mouse infestations, including several conventional break-back traps, humane traps, electronic repellers, electronic killing devices and rodenticides.
